# HTML5 and CSS3 Fundamentals
Currently I'm studying an online [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/html5-fundamentals-for-beginners/) on Udemy about how to using HTML and CSS basically. My purpose of learning this course is just to build my own stable website where I can put my posts on.

As my description, I am a guy who pretty enjoys writing but sometimes it seems unconvenient for me to post on some social media platforms. Therefore, I tend to make this website by my own in order to post comfortably and learn about HTML and CSS as well.

If this website goes well, probably, I will develop it further.
